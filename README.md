# Hear
Boilerplate for Jack and PyAudio


## Why?
[PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) offers a binding for the
old good [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), it works everywhere but is
quite low-level and if you are using [Jack](http://jackaudio.org/) can be painful
(ok, it is supported, but I was not able to create a client, nor to find working
code by someone else).

[Jack-Client](https://github.com/spatialaudio/jackclient-python/) is way better,
but, obviously, works only with an active Jack server.

I want both.

## Usage
To read audio from the microphone:
```python
from hear import hear


def callback(data):
    left  = data[0]
    right = data[1]
    # do stuff

hear(callback)
```
where `data` is a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) array.

If you have an active Jack server running the callback is processed by a Jack
client, otherwise by PyAudio.

`hear` takes also other arguments:
```python
def hear(callback, channels=2, body=None, jack_client="Hear"):
    ...
```
`jack_client` is the client name, and `body` is the action (a function) performed
while the client/pa-stream is running, by default:
```python
def body():
    try:
        while True:
            sleep(0.1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Interrupted by user")
```

## Known Issues
- If you change the Jack state you have to reload the whole application. (To
  check the available backends Hear uses PyAudio, and the C part inizializes
  everything just one time storing the state in some global variables)
